**Environmental Factors predicting solitary bee distributions**

This project will test a variety of environmental factors to discover whether any of these predict the distribution of solitary bees

```{r}
library (dplyr)
#| echo: false

```

**We imported data that was exported by the bio diverse package**

```{r}
#| echo: false
bee_data <- read.csv("~/bees_climate/data/BeeDataNoiNatSpecimensPerCell.csv")

```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).
