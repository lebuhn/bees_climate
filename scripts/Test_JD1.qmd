#### Environmental Factors Predicting Solitary Bee Distributions

This is a project that will test a variety of environmental variables to discover whether any of these predict the distribution of solitary bees.

We begin by downloading and installing libraries to R

```{r}
#| echo: false
install.packages('dplyr')
library(dplyr)

```

We import data that was exported by the Biodiverse package for Gilbert Alacon-Cruz thesis.

```{r}
#| echo: false
bee_data <- read.csv('~/Github/bees_climate/data/BeeDataNoiNatSpecimensPerCell.csv')

```
